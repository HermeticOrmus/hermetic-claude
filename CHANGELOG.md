- `/dissolve` - DISSOLVTIO (Water) - Research, explore codebases
- `/separate` - SEPARATIO (Air) - Code review, filter quality
- `/conjoin` - CONIVNCTIO (Union) - Merge branches, integrate systems
- `/ferment` - FERMENTATIO (Rebirth) - TDD cycles, iterate until quality

- `/tinctvra` - TINCTVRA (Gold) - Create Skills, Commands, Agents
- `/coagulate` - COAGVLATIO (Earth) - Deploy to production

#### Modern Extensions
- `/fusion` - Advanced conceptual fusion with full mathematical depth
- `/emanate` - Push to GitHub with professional versioning

#### Infrastructure
- Complete skill library (50+ skills)
- Command library (100+ commands)
- Specialized agents (Alembic, MARS, MERCVRIO, meta2)
- Hermetic philosophy documentation
- Workshop for AI-assisted development
- Meta-prompting framework

#### Mathematical Foundations
- Category Theory integration (functors, monads, adjunctions)
- Quantum mechanics for pattern perception
- Information theory for entropy reduction
