# Ormus Illustrator

Multi-provider AI illustration engine with an LLM-first philosophy.

> **"LLMs are the chill, reliable grown-up in the room."**

---

## The Core Philosophy

Image generators wake up each morning with a new personality. Even the best ones struggle with consistent personal style. Midjourney has taste, but also a temper.

**The solution:** Use Claude as a thinking partner *before* touching any image tool.

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Claude** | Structure, consistency, prompt refinement |
| **Image Tool** | Aesthetics, visual execution |
| **You** | Taste, curation, direction |

This creates stability in an inherently chaotic process.

---

## Phase 0: Think Before You Generate

**Before jumping into any provider, have a conversation with Claude about:**

### 1. Context Building
Ask yourself (or let Claude help you articulate):
- **What** am I creating? (illustration, icon, character, scene?)
- **Who** is it for? (children, developers, myself?)
- **Tone** — playful, serious, ethereal, scientific?
- **Colors** — specific palette or mood-driven?
- **References** — what existing work feels "right"?

### 2. Personal Design Scaffold (Optional but Powerful)
Write down how you think when designing:
- What do you look at first?
- How do you choose a direction?
- What do you avoid?
- How do you explore ideas?

Once Claude knows your logic, prompts feel surprisingly aligned.

### 3. Example Conversation Opener
```
I'm creating illustrations for [project].
Target audience: [who]
Feeling I want: [adjectives]
Colors I'm drawn to: [colors]
Things I want to avoid: [anti-patterns]
References that feel right: [links or descriptions]

Help me think through this before we generate anything.
```

## The Positive Loop

This is where the magic happens:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                      │
│   Claude      →     Prompt     →    Image Tool      │
│     ↑                                    │          │
│     │                                    ↓          │
│   Tell Claude    ←   Mood Board   ←   Output       │
│   "we evolved"                                      │
│                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Chat with Claude** about what you're making
2. **Share references** from your mood board
3. **Let Claude build prompts** that match your logic
4. **Run them** in the appropriate provider
5. **Take good results** → add to mood board
6. **Tell Claude** "Look, we just evolved the style!"

After a few rounds, your style becomes surprisingly stable.

---

## Mood Board Workflow

Your mood board is your **visual anchor**.

**Collect things you love:**
- Colors and gradients
- Textures and patterns
- Photography/illustration styles
- Small visual cues that feel "right"

**Keep it clean.** A cluttered board = unclear direction.

**Storage suggestion:** `~/projects/[project]/mood-board/`

**Evolve it.** As you generate good outputs, add them back. The board grows with your style.

---

## When This Skill Activates

- User says "illustrate", "draw", "create an image", "generate a picture"
- User requests visual content for any project
- User needs graphics, artwork, or rendered images
- User mentions "midjourney" for artistic/hand-drawn styles
- User wants "pixel art", "animation", "sprite", or "animate"

- **Per-project**: Use `--output "PATH"` flag

---

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Provider | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Gemini | `gcloud auth application-default login` |
| 429 Rate Limited | Any | Wait 1-2 minutes |

## Example: La Gran Obra Childlike Style

For hand-drawn, crayon-like, blob-shape illustrations:

```bash
# Midjourney prompt for childlike style
python3 midjourney.py "childlike crayon drawing, wobbly organic blob shape, bright yellow color, hand-drawn imperfect lines, no background, simple joyful character, marker texture --v 6.1 --s 150 --ar 1:1" --name yellow-blob --output ~/projects/01-ACTIVE/la-gran-obra/public/assets/shapes/
```

**Style keywords for childlike aesthetic:**
- "childlike crayon drawing"
- "hand-drawn imperfect lines"
- "wobbly organic shapes"
- "marker texture"
- "finger-paint style"
- "simple joyful"
- "no background" or "transparent background"

---

## Provider 4: PixelLab (Pixel Art & Animations)

```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/ormus-illustrator/providers && python3 pixellab.py "ACTION" --image REFERENCE.png --name OUTPUT
```

**Generate animation from reference:**
```bash
python3 pixellab.py "walking" --image turpi.png --name turpi-walk --size 64 --frames 4
```

```bash
python3 pixellab.py "breathing idle" --image turpi.png --name turpi-idle --frames 8
```

**Generate waving animation:**
```bash
python3 pixellab.py "waving hello" --image turpi.png --name turpi-wave --size 32
```

**Parameters:**
| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--image/-i` | Reference image (required) | - |
| `--name/-n` | Output name prefix | animation |

## Gentle Iteration (No Need to Grind)

Early results might feel rough — totally normal.

But as the loop continues:
- Your prompts become sharper
- The tool begins to "understand" your vibe
- Your mood board gains personality
- A unique style emerges

**You'll notice something special:**
- Claude handles structure
- The image tool handles aesthetics
- You handle taste

---

## The Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Jump straight to generation | You lose the thinking phase |
| Overload mood boards | Cluttered board = unclear direction |
| Expect instant perfection | Style emerges through iteration |
| Ignore good "accidents" | Sometimes the tool surprises you — save those |
| Fight the tool's personality | Work with its strengths, not against them |

---

## Final Wisdom

This workflow is not about being technical. It's about:

- **Reducing guesswork** in an inherently chaotic process
- **Building a stable creative backbone** with Claude as the consistent partner
- **Letting AI understand your taste** through conversation
- **Growing your style** slowly, naturally, one prompt at a time

It's simple, really. Just a conversation between you and your tools.

No pressure. No heavy theory. Just a path that helps your visual voice grow.
