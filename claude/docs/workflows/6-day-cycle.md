# The 6-Day Development Cycle

Following the Principle of Rhythm:

## The Cycle

- **Day 1**: Ideate & Research (Mentalism - clarify intention)
- **Day 2**: Design & Plan (Correspondence - architecture reflects values)
- **Day 3-4**: Build (Vibration - ship and iterate)
- **Day 5**: Test & Polish (Cause-Effect - conscious quality)
- **Day 6**: Launch (Gender - analysis + intuition = completion)
- **Rest**: Integrate, celebrate, prepare (Rhythm - sacred rest)

## Philosophy

**Rest is sacred. Never 7-day work weeks.**

Sustainable pace > heroic sprints. Burnout serves no one.

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1: Ideate & Research

**Focus**: Understanding and intention-setting

**Activities**:
- Research problem space
- Understand user needs
- Review existing solutions
- Clarify WHY this matters
- Document intentions

**Output**: Clear problem statement and research notes

**Hermetic Principle**: Mentalism - "Before writing code, clarify intention"

---

### Day 2: Design & Plan

**Focus**: Architecture and approach

**Activities**:
- Design system architecture
- Plan implementation approach
- Identify dependencies
- Create technical specification
- Define success criteria

**Output**: Technical design document and plan

**Hermetic Principle**: Correspondence - "Architecture reflects values"

---

### Day 3-4: Build

**Focus**: Implementation and iteration

**Activities**:
- Write code (TDD approach)
- Commit frequently
- Iterate based on feedback
- Ship imperfect work
- Refactor as you go

**Output**: Working implementation with tests

**Hermetic Principle**: Vibration - "Ship imperfect work; iterate rapidly"

---

### Day 5: Test & Polish

**Focus**: Quality and refinement

**Activities**:
- Run full test suite
- Fix bugs discovered
- Improve code quality
- Optimize performance
- Complete documentation

**Output**: Production-ready code

**Hermetic Principle**: Cause-Effect - "Intentional actions yield meaningful results"

---

### Day 6: Launch

**Focus**: Deployment and completion

**Activities**:
- Final verification
- Deploy to production
- Monitor initial usage
- Document learnings
- Celebrate completion

**Output**: Deployed feature and retrospective

**Hermetic Principle**: Gender - "Balance masculine/feminine energies" (Analysis + Intuition)

---

### Rest Day

**Focus**: Integration and recovery

**Activities**:
- Rest completely (no work)
- Reflect on the cycle
- Integrate learnings
- Celebrate achievements
- Prepare for next cycle

**Output**: Restored energy and clear mind

**Hermetic Principle**: Rhythm - "Everything flows"

---

## Adaptation Guidelines

**Shorter cycles**: For smaller features, compress to 3-day cycle (design, build, launch) + rest

**Longer projects**: Multiple 6-day cycles, with rest between each

**Emergency work**: Can break cycle for true emergencies, but make up rest later

**Team coordination**: Synchronize cycles across team when possible

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Working through rest day** - Burnout inevitable
❌ **Skipping planning** - Rework costs more time
❌ **No reflection** - Miss learning opportunities
❌ **Rushing launch** - Quality suffers
❌ **Indefinite building** - Ship something, iterate

---

## Integration with Other Workflows

**RIPER Workflow**: Can span multiple 6-day cycles
**Dev Docs**: Document each cycle's work
**TDD**: Use during Build days (Day 3-4)

---

## Tracking Your Cycle

**Start of cycle**: Note date and goal
**Daily check-in**: Am I on the right day's focus?
**End of cycle**: Reflect and document learnings
**Rest day**: Truly rest

**Template**:
```markdown
# Cycle [Number] - [Feature Name]

**Dates**: [Start] to [End]
**Goal**: [What we're building]

## Daily Log
- Day 1 (Research): [Notes]
- Day 2 (Design): [Notes]
- Day 3 (Build): [Notes]
- Day 4 (Build): [Notes]
- Day 5 (Polish): [Notes]
- Day 6 (Launch): [Notes]
- Rest: [Reflections]

## Learnings
[What worked, what didn't, what to improve]
```

## Benefits

**Sustainability**: Prevents burnout
**Quality**: Time for both creation and refinement
**Learning**: Regular reflection builds wisdom
**Predictability**: Clear expectations for team
**Balance**: Work and rest in harmony
