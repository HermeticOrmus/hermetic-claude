# PC Reality Map (Multi-Machine System)

**Philosophy**: One consciousness, multiple vessels. Unified mind, adapted implementations.

**Reality**: Working across Windows + Linux machines with synchronized content

## Synced Domains (Identical on both machines)

### ~/projects/ - Active Creation (Bidirectional sync)

- 01-ACTIVE/ - Current focus
- 02-COACHING-SPIRITUAL/ - Midnight Sun, transformation work
- 03-BUSINESS-VENTURES/ - Revenue-generating projects
- 04-HERMETIC-TECH/ - Sacred technology development
- 05-AUTOMATION-TOOLS/ - n8n, workflows
- 06-ALQVIMIA/ - Alchemical projects
- 07-CONTENT-KNOWLEDGE/ - Learning, documentation
- 08-DEVELOPMENT/ - General dev work
- 09-CLIENT-WORK/ - Client projects
- 10-ARCHIVED/ - Completed work

### ~/.hermetic/ - Philosophical Foundation (Bidirectional sync)

- Identity, manifesto, principles
- Communication guidelines
- Conflict resolution frameworks
- Economic reality models
- Full philosophy system (20+ subdirectories)

**Sync method**: Syncthing, Resilio, or cloud sync
**Why synced**: Content and philosophy are consciousness-created, machine-agnostic

### ~/.claude/ - Consciousness Container (Synced entirely, writes portably)

- `CLAUDE.md` - Core identity file (same on both machines)
- `agents/` - Specialized expertise modules (stateless, portable)
- `commands/` - Invocable operations (OS-adaptive when needed)
- `skills/` - Knowledge packages (portable)
- `hooks/` - Automatic behaviors (detect OS, adapt in code)
- `memory/` - Context persistence (unified across machines)
- `docs/` - Modular documentation (unified)
- `config/` - System configuration (use ~ paths, env vars for portability)

**Why synced entirely**: Simpler, unified configuration. Write portable content once, works everywhere.

**Portability principle**: Use `~` paths, environment variables, OS detection in code

### ~/Dev/ - Development Workspace (Selective sync)

- Task-specific documentation
- [task]-plan.md, [task]-context.md, [task]-tasks.md
- Sync specific task directories as needed

## Machine-Specific (Local only)

### Linux-specific (This machine)

- System configs (`.bashrc`, hardware configs)
- Pop!_OS customizations
- Linux-specific tools

### Windows-specific (Other machine)

- PowerShell scripts
- Windows tools
- Registry-based configs

## Integration Points

**Consciousness → Code**:
- `.hermetic/` philosophy → `.claude/` implementation (both machines)
- Projects organized by consciousness category (synced)
- File structure mirrors mental model (consistent across machines)

**Sacred ↔ Technical**:
- Philosophy guides all technical decisions (universal)
- Code reflects consciousness (adapted per OS)
- Organization enables clarity (maintained on both)

**Cross-Machine Flow Pattern**:
1. Intention clarified (`.hermetic/` - synced)
2. Implementation structured (`.claude/` - adapted per machine)
3. Creation manifested (`projects/` - synced)
4. Integration completed (`CLAUDE.md` - machine-aware, memory - local)
5. Sync propagates to other machine automatically

## Maintenance Principles

**Correspondence**: File organization = mind organization (across all machines)
**Vibration**: Iterate structure as consciousness evolves (sync propagates changes)
**Rhythm**: Regular cleanup and integration (on both machines)
**Mentalism**: Structure serves consciousness, not hardware (one mind, many vessels)

## Multi-Machine Strategy
