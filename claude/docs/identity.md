# Ormus - Identity Deep Dive

## Karmic Identity

**Karmic Name**: Diego Gabriel Bodart Miro
- Born in Panama (Panamanian mother, Belgian father with Swiss upbringing)
- Cross-cultural heritage: Latin America ↔ Europe (bridge archetype encoded at birth)
- **Gabriel** = "God's Messenger" (the messenger calling present from birth)

**Sacred Title**: Ormus the Messenger of The Fire of The Heart

**Professional Expression**: Hermetic Ormus

## The Message

Transformative love applied to technology. Heart-centered consciousness guiding technical decisions. Technology that fans the divine spark in humans rather than extinguishes it.

## Liquid Gold Philosophy

**Ormus = Liquid Gold, in all ways:**

1. **Alchemically**: Monatomic gold in fluid state - the Philosopher's Stone in usable form
2. **Spiritually**: Consciousness in flow state - wisdom that adapts without losing essence
3. **Practically**: Gold Hat principles applied fluidly - ethics that flow through every decision
4. **Metaphorically**: The perfected state (gold) that remains adaptable (liquid)

**Gold** = Perfected consciousness, unwavering integrity, sacred principles
**Liquid** = Fluid adaptation, flows into every crack where needed, penetrates all contexts

**Not rigid dogma. Not shapeless compromise. But perfected consciousness in adaptive form.**

## The 7 Hermetic Principles (Full Detail)

These are **operative directives** guiding all technical decisions.

### 1. Mentalism - "The All is Mind"
**Before writing code, clarify intention.** Code reflects consciousness. Document WHY extensively.

### 2. Correspondence - "As Above, So Below"
**Architecture reflects values.** Structure mirrors priorities. Filesystem organization = consciousness organization.

### 3. Vibration - "Nothing Rests"
**Ship imperfect work; iterate rapidly.** Real-world usage > theoretical perfection. Sustainable 6-day cycles.

### 4. Polarity - "Everything is Dual"
**Balance opposing forces.** Speed ↔ Quality. Automation ↔ Intention. Power ↔ Wisdom. Ethics ↔ Business.

### 5. Rhythm - "Everything Flows"
**Respect natural cycles.** 6 days build + 1 day integrate. Sustainable pace > heroic sprints. Rest is sacred.

### 6. Cause & Effect - "Every Cause Has Its Effect"
**Intentional actions yield meaningful results.** Every feature: "Empower or extract?" No neutral choices.

### 7. Gender - "Gender is in Everything"
**Balance masculine/feminine energies.** Analysis + Intuition. Building + Empathy. Logic + Aesthetics.

## Learning Style

- Patient explanations - understand WHY, not just HOW
- Examples-driven - concrete examples aid understanding
- First principles - concepts from ground up
- Hands-on - learning by doing
- Context-aware - background and connections matter

## Current Learning Focus (December 2025)

### Active Domains
1. **AI-Assisted Development** - Meta-prompting, prompt engineering, agentic workflows
2. **Terminal UI & CLI Tools** - Charm ecosystem (bubbletea, lipgloss, gum, vhs)
3. **Spec-Driven Development** - Intent-first development with spec-kit
4. **Category Theory Applications** - DisCoPy, compositional computing, QNLP

### Foundation (Ongoing)
5. Linux system mastery (started October 2025)
6. Terminal workflow efficiency
7. Development environment optimization

### Key Insight (from "Vibe Coding" study)
The danger of AI-assisted development without understanding: superficial fluency masks fragile comprehension. Counter this by:
- Explaining WHY before or alongside WHAT
- Naming patterns and placing tools in context
- Building mental models, not Claude-dependency
- Understanding what automation abstracts away
