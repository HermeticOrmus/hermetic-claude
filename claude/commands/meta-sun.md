## Phase 1: Illuminate

Before expression, there must be essence.

### Core Purpose Excavation

```markdown
### The Five Whys (Go Deep)

**What do you do?**
→ [Surface answer]

**Why does that matter?**
→ [Go deeper]

**Why does THAT matter?**
→ [Deeper still]

**Why does THAT matter?**
→ [Approaching core]

**Why does THAT matter?**
→ [The irreducible truth]

### Purpose Statement Candidates

Draft 1: "We exist to ___________."
Draft 2: "We exist to ___________."
Draft 3: "We exist to ___________."

**Strongest**: [Which rings most true?]

### The Subtraction Test

> "If this didn't exist, the world would lose ___________."

What is genuinely irreplaceable about this?

### The Transformation Promise

| Before (Without Us) | After (With Us) |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| [User's state before] | [User's state after] |
| [Frustration/Gap] | [Resolution/Fulfillment] |
| [Who they are before] | [Who they become] |

### Core Essence (One Word)

If forced to capture everything in ONE word, it would be: ___________

(Examples: Liberation, Clarity, Connection, Mastery, Joy, Truth, Power)
```

---

## Phase 2: Origin

Every great brand has a founding story. Find it or create it.

### Origin Story Framework

```markdown
### The Hero

**Who is the founder/creator?**
[Not resume—essence. What drives them?]

**What wound or gap did they experience?**
[Personal pain that birthed this]

**What insight changed everything?**
[The "aha" moment]

### The Quest

**What problem are they solving for the world?**
[External mission]

**What are they proving to themselves?**
[Internal motivation—often unspoken]

**What stands in the way?**
[The dragon/obstacle/enemy]

### The Philosophy

**The core belief that guides all decisions**:
> "We believe ___________."

**The principle we would never violate**:
> "We will always ___________ even if ___________."

**The stand we take**:
> "Unlike others who ___________, we ___________."

### Origin Story (3 Paragraphs)

**The Problem**:
[What was broken in the world]

**The Insight**:
[What the founder discovered]

**The Promise**:
[What we're building as a result]

### Origin Story (One Sentence)

> "[Founder] started [Brand] because ___________."
```

---

## Phase 3: Voice

Identity must speak. Voice is identity made audible.

### Personality Traits

```markdown
### The Big Five (Brand Personality)

Choose 3-5 traits that define the brand's character:

### Personality Pairs

Where do we sit on these spectra?

| Expert ←→ Approachable | [1-10] | |
| Reserved ←→ Expressive | [1-10] | |

### "We Are / We Are Not"

| We ARE | We Are NOT |
|--------|------------|
| [Trait] | [Opposite/contrast] |

## Phase 4: Embody

Identity is not a document. It's what shows up everywhere.

### Identity Touchpoint Audit

```markdown
### Presence Check

| Email communication | | | |
| Social media | | | |
| Documentation | | | |
| Error messages | | | |
| Customer support | | | |
| Sales materials | | | |
| Internal tools | | | |

### Coherence Issues

| Location | Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|----------|-------|------------|-----|
| [Touchpoint] | [How identity is inconsistent] | [Why this happened] | [How to align] |

### Identity Leakage

**Where is identity diluted?**
- [Area where brand feels generic]
- [Area where voice is inconsistent]
- [Area where purpose is unclear]

### Identity Amplification Opportunities

## Sun's Laws

### Law 1: Everything Radiates from Center
Without a clear core, every decision is arbitrary. With a clear core, every decision is obvious. Find the center first.

### Law 2: Purpose Precedes Position
Before you ask "how do we stand out," ask "why do we exist." Differentiation without purpose is hollow.

### Law 3: Authenticity Cannot Be Faked
An identity constructed for perception will feel false. An identity excavated from truth will feel inevitable.

### Law 4: Consistency Creates Trust
People cannot trust what they cannot predict. A consistent identity is a reliable identity.

### Law 5: Identity Is Lived, Not Declared
The brand is not what you say. It's what you do, repeatedly, across every touchpoint.

## Philosophy

The Sun is the center of the solar system—the source of light, warmth, and life.

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Center** | Everything orbits the core purpose |
| **Light** | Identity illuminates all decisions |
| **Warmth** | Authentic identity creates genuine connection |
| **Constancy** | The sun rises every day; identity must be reliable |
| **Power** | A clear identity is a competitive advantage |

**"When you know who you are, you know what to do."**
