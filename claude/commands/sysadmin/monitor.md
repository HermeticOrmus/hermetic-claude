# System Monitoring

Please help me check the overall health and performance of this system.

Monitoring checklist:
1. **CPU Usage**: Check CPU load and processes
2. **Memory**: RAM and swap usage
3. **Disk**: Disk space and I/O
4. **Network**: Network traffic and connectivity
5. **Processes**: Running processes and resource consumption
6. **Services**: Status of critical services
7. **Temperatures**: System temperatures (if available)
8. **Logs**: Recent errors or warnings

Provide a summary of system health and flag any concerns. Suggest optimizations if issues are found.
