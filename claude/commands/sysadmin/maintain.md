# System Maintenance

Please help me perform routine system maintenance on this Pop!_OS machine.

Maintenance checklist:
1. **Updates**: Check and install system updates (`apt update && apt upgrade`)
2. **Cleanup**: Remove unused packages (`apt autoremove`)
3. **Cache**: Clean package cache if needed
4. **Logs**: Check system logs for issues (`journalctl -p 3 -b`)
5. **Disk Space**: Check disk usage (`df -h`)
6. **Services**: Verify critical services are running
7. **Security**: Check for security updates
8. **Backup**: Verify backup systems are working

Run each step carefully and report findings. Ask before performing potentially destructive operations.
