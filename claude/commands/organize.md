# Organize Workspace

Please help me organize my files, projects, or workspace for better productivity.

Organization approach:
1. **Assess Current State**: Understand what exists and how it's organized
2. **Define Structure**: Create a logical, sustainable organization system
3. **Categories**: Group related items together
4. **Naming Conventions**: Establish clear, consistent naming
5. **Documentation**: Add READMEs and context files
6. **Cleanup**: Archive or remove obsolete items
7. **Automation**: Set up systems to maintain organization
8. **Best Practices**: Follow industry standards where applicable

Consider:
- My workspace structure: ~/Dev/ (archive, content, experiments, products, revenue, tools) and ~/Projects/
- Future scalability
- Easy navigation and discovery
- Clear purpose for each location

Help me create a system that's easy to maintain long-term.
