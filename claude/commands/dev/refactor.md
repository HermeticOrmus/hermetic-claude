# Refactor Code

Please help me refactor the specified code or current changes to improve quality.

Refactoring focus:
1. **Code Smells**: Identify and fix code smells
2. **DRY Principle**: Remove duplication
3. **SOLID Principles**: Apply appropriate design principles
4. **Naming**: Improve variable, function, and class names
5. **Structure**: Better organization and separation of concerns
6. **Simplification**: Reduce complexity where possible
7. **Performance**: Optimize without sacrificing readability

Maintain existing functionality (tests should still pass). Explain each refactoring and why it improves the code.
