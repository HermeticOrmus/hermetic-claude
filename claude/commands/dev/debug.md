# Debug Issue

I'm experiencing a bug or issue. Please help me debug it systematically.

Debugging approach:
1. **Understand the problem**: What's the expected vs actual behavior?
2. **Reproduce**: Can we consistently reproduce it?
3. **Isolate**: Narrow down where the issue occurs
4. **Analyze**: Examine code, logs, and error messages
5. **Hypothesize**: What could be causing this?
6. **Test**: Verify hypotheses with tests or experiments
7. **Fix**: Implement a solution
8. **Verify**: Confirm the fix works and doesn't break anything

Think through this methodically. If we need more information, ask specific questions.
