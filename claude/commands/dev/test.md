# Generate Tests

Please help me create comprehensive tests for the specified code or current changes.

Test requirements:
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and unusual inputs
4. **Error Cases**: Test error handling and recovery
5. **Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage
6. **Documentation**: Clear test descriptions and comments

Use appropriate testing framework for the project. Write clear, maintainable tests that serve as documentation.
