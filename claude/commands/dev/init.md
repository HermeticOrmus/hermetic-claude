# Initialize Development Project

I need to initialize a new development project with proper structure and configuration.

Please help me:

1. **Understand the project type**: Ask what kind of project (web app, CLI tool, library, etc.)
2. **Choose tech stack**: Recommend appropriate technologies based on the project type
3. **Create structure**: Set up proper directory structure following best practices
4. **Initialize tools**: Set up git, package manager, linting, formatting, testing
5. **Documentation**: Create README.md, CLAUDE.md, and basic documentation
6. **Development environment**: Configure development settings and tools
7. **Best practices**: Include .gitignore, .editorconfig, and other standard files

Focus on creating a solid foundation that follows modern best practices and is maintainable long-term.
