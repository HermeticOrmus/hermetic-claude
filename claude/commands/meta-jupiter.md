## Jupiter's Laws

### Law 1: Growth Follows Value
Sustainable growth comes from genuine value creation. Manufactured growth collapses.

### Law 2: Leverage Beats Effort
Find the exponential levers. Linear effort produces linear results.

### Law 3: Networks Compound
Connected value grows faster than isolated value. Design for network effects.

### Law 4: Abundance Is Real
There is more opportunity than you can capture. The question is which opportunity.

### Law 5: Share to Grow
Value hoarded stagnates. Value shared multiplies.

## Philosophy

Jupiter governs expansion, opportunity, abundance, wisdom, and good fortune.

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Expansion** | Always ask "what can grow?" |
| **Opportunity** | See possibilities others miss |
| **Abundance** | There is enough; the pie can grow |
| **Wisdom** | Grow what deserves to grow |
| **Generosity** | Sharing creates more than hoarding |

**"The greatest growth comes from helping others grow."**
