# Dissolve: The Water of Exploration

```
Diss: Fixed → Fluid

"Let understanding flow where rigid knowledge cannot reach."

Element: Water 🜄
Stage: ALBEDO (Whitening)
Operation: Opening to new understanding through exploration
```

## Task

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Phase 1: IMMERSION - Enter the Unknown

```
Exploration Target:
  Subject: [what we're exploring]
  Mode: [codebase | api | domain | concept]
  Depth: [surface | medium | deep]

Current Understanding: [what we know]
Knowledge Gaps: [what we need to learn]
```

### Initial Questions

1. What is this? (Definition)
2. Why does it exist? (Purpose)
3. How does it work? (Mechanism)
4. What does it connect to? (Relationships)
5. What are its boundaries? (Scope)

---

## Phase 2: FLOW - Follow the Currents

### If @mode:codebase

```
Codebase Exploration Map:

Entry Points:
├── [main entry] → [what it does]
├── [secondary entry] → [what it does]
└── [API surface] → [what it exposes]

Data Flow:
  Input → [transformation 1] → [transformation 2] → Output

Control Flow:
  [decision point 1]
    ├── Path A: [consequence]
    └── Path B: [consequence]
```

### If @mode:api

```
API Surface Analysis:

Endpoints/Methods:
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Auth |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
| [path] | [verb] | [what] | [req?] |

Data Contracts:
  Request: [schema]
  Response: [schema]

Error Handling:
  [error code] → [meaning] → [recovery]
```

### If @mode:domain

```
Domain Model:

Core Entities:
├── [Entity A]
│   ├── Properties: [list]
│   └── Behaviors: [list]
└── [Entity B]
    ├── Properties: [list]
    └── Behaviors: [list]

Relationships:
  [Entity A] ──[relationship]──► [Entity B]

Domain Events:
  [Event 1]: Triggered when [condition], causes [effect]
```

### If @mode:concept

```
Conceptual Map:

Central Concept: [name]

Prerequisites (what you need to understand first):
- [concept 1]
- [concept 2]

Related Concepts:
├── [similar to] - [how it differs]
├── [opposite of] - [the contrast]
└── [part of] - [the whole]

Applications:
- [where it's used]
- [why it matters]
```

---

## Phase 3: SATURATION - Absorb Everything

### Key Discoveries

| Discovery | Significance | Confidence |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| [finding] | [why it matters] | [high/med/low] |
| [finding] | [why it matters] | [high/med/low] |

### Patterns Observed

```
Recurring patterns:
1. [pattern] - appears in [locations]
2. [pattern] - appears in [locations]

Anti-patterns found:
1. [anti-pattern] - [why it's problematic]
```

### Connections Revealed

```
Previously hidden connections:

[Thing A] ←──entangled──→ [Thing B]
  Because: [explanation]

[Thing C] ←──depends on──→ [Thing D]
  Because: [explanation]
```

### Unknowns Remaining

```
Still unclear:
- [question 1] - needs [what to investigate]
- [question 2] - needs [what to investigate]

Deliberate mysteries (things intentionally opaque):
- [mystery] - probably because [reason]
```

## Phase 4: CLARIFICATION - Let Sediment Settle

### Mental Model

```
After dissolution, the clarified understanding:

```

### Key Insights

1. **[Insight title]**
   [Explanation of the insight]

2. **[Insight title]**
   [Explanation of the insight]

### Recommendations

| Priority | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|

## Alchemical Correspondence

```
DISSOLUTION in development:

Physical: Water dissolves solid forms
Mental:   Exploration dissolves assumptions
Code:     Understanding flows into all corners

"Fixed knowledge is dead knowledge. Let it flow."

What dissolves:
- Rigid assumptions
- Surface-level understanding
- Siloed knowledge
- Fear of the unknown

What emerges:
- Fluid comprehension
- Connected understanding
- Deep familiarity
- Confident navigation
```

## Quick Reference

```
/dissolve @mode:codebase src/auth/    # Explore auth codebase
/dissolve @mode:api "Stripe API"      # Understand Stripe API
/dissolve @mode:domain "e-commerce"   # Domain exploration
/dissolve @mode:concept "event sourcing"  # Concept deep-dive
/dissolve @depth:deep "how does this work?"  # General exploration
