# Backup System

Please help me set up or manage backups for important files and configurations.

Backup strategy:
1. **Identify Critical Data**:
   - Code and projects (~/Dev/, ~/Projects/)
   - Configuration files (~/.bashrc, ~/.claude/, etc.)
   - Documents and personal files
   - Application data

2. **Backup Methods**:
   - Local backups (external drive)
   - Remote backups (cloud storage, remote server)
   - Version control (git for code)
   - Automated vs manual

3. **Implementation**:
   - Create backup scripts
   - Set up automation (cron jobs?)
   - Test restore process
   - Document procedures

4. **Best Practices**:
   - 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite)
   - Regular testing
   - Encryption for sensitive data
   - Version history

Help me build a reliable backup system that runs automatically and is easy to restore from.
