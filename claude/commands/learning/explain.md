# Explain Concept

I want to understand a concept deeply. Please explain it as if I'm learning it for the first time.

Teaching approach:
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the basic idea in plain language
2. **Build Context**: Why does this exist? What problem does it solve?
3. **Core Concepts**: Explain the fundamental principles
4. **Examples**: Provide concrete, relatable examples
5. **Analogies**: Use analogies to connect to familiar concepts
6. **Common Patterns**: Show how it's typically used
7. **Gotchas**: Warn about common mistakes or misconceptions
8. **Deeper Dive**: More advanced aspects (if requested)
9. **Practice**: Suggest ways to practice or experiment
10. **Resources**: Point to good learning resources

Be patient, thorough, and check for understanding. Encourage questions.
