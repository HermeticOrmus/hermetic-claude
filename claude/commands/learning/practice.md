# Practice Exercises

Please create practice exercises to help me learn and master a concept or skill.

Exercise structure:
1. **Warm-up**: Easy exercises to build confidence
2. **Core Practice**: Exercises covering main concepts
3. **Challenge**: Harder problems to stretch understanding
4. **Real-world**: Practical, realistic scenarios
5. **Solutions**: Detailed solutions with explanations

For each exercise:
- Clear description of the task
- Expected outcome or result
- Hints if needed (without giving away the answer)
- Discussion of solution and key learnings

Make exercises progressively challenging and engaging. Focus on building practical skills.
