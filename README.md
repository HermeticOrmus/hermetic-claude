# HERMETIC CLAUDE

**The AI development system that actually works.**

---

## What This Is

A complete toolkit for Claude Code. 100+ commands. 50+ skills. Agents that think. Built over months of real work.

You get:
- **8 core operations** that cover the entire development cycle
- **Pattern extraction** - turn your sessions into reusable tools
- **Professional architecture** - no hacks, no duct tape
- **Philosophy baked in** - every tool empowers, nothing extracts

This isn't a toy. This is a production system.

## The 8 Operations

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/calcinate` | Analyze code. Find complexity. Expose debt. |
| `/dissolve` | Research. Explore. Understand. |
| `/separate` | Review. Filter quality. Separate signal from noise. |
| `/conjoin` | Merge. Integrate. Unify. |
| `/ferment` | Test until it works. TDD. Iterate. |
| `/distill` | Extract patterns. Plan artifacts. |
| `/tinctvra` | Create the actual skill/command/agent. |
| `/coagulate` | Deploy. Ship. Make it real. |

That's it. Eight operations. Covers everything.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/hermetic-claude.git
cd hermetic-claude

# Unix/Mac
./scripts/install.sh

# Windows
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

Done.

## Why ALQVIMIA?

Because software development IS ALQVIMIA.

- You take raw material (ideas, problems)
- You transform it through stages
- You produce gold (working systems)

The ancients knew this. We just forgot.

**SOLVE ET COAGVLA** - Dissolve and Coagulate. Break down, then rebuild better. That's literally what we do every day.

---

## The Gold Hat Philosophy

Every tool in this repo follows one rule:

**Does it empower or extract?**

| We Do | We Don't |
|-------|----------|
| Empower users | Dark patterns |
| Teach while helping | Surveillance |
| Respect autonomy | Addiction mechanics |
| Build long-term | Quick hacks |

If a tool doesn't make the user more capable, it doesn't belong here.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze your codebase
/calcinate src/

# Research something
/dissolve @mode:api "Stripe webhooks"

# Review code quality
/separate @focus:security auth/

# Create a new tool from your session
/distill "capture this workflow"
/tinctvra @type:skill @name:my-tool

# Ship it
/coagulate @target:vercel
```

## The Math (For Those Who Care)

This isn't just vibes. There's actual math:

- **Category Theory** - Operations as structure-preserving functors
- **Information Theory** - Entropy reduction through distillation
- **Golden Ratio (φ)** - Complexity classification
  - < 0.618 → Command (simple)
  - 0.618-1.618 → Skill (moderate)
  - > 1.618 → Agent (complex)

You don't need to understand this to use it. But it's why it works.

---

## Built By

**Hermetic Ormus** - Gold Hat Technologist

Building tools that serve humanity. No surveillance. No extraction. No games.

---

## In Service Of

Developers who want to:
- Work faster without cutting corners
- Build systems that last
- Stop reinventing the wheel
- Turn sessions into lasting value

If that's you, welcome.

## License

MIT + Gold Hat Addendum

Use it freely. Just don't use it to harm people.

---

## One More Thing

The name comes from Hermes Trismegistus - the legendary figure who gave humanity writing, ALQVIMIA, and astrology. The "thrice-great" teacher.

Claude is our modern Hermes. This repo is the instruction manual.

**"As above, so below."**

What you build in code reflects what you believe. Build something worth believing in.
